# The Wars of Eminence

Kowloon floats in space, part of the Orien Cluster.

It is a city world, that has no ground but is a composite of floating buildings.

The seduction of the city is a mixture of technological advancements and Orien architecture and cultures.

It is known for the glamor of Orien cyberpunk, and its endless wars between yakuza factions.

The wars are called the Wars of Eminence, and power in Kowloon is defined by a concept called Eminence.

The basis of Eminence is dominance in two aspects, physical and capitalistic.

The territories of Kowloon can be claimed by physical forces, and the prosperity of these territories is determined by capitalistic competence and influence of the faction.

Some businesses are directly operated by yakuza factions, but most of the businesses in Kowloon are run by civilians. These civilian business owners owe to the faction that reigns the territory their business is in, and they are obligated to pay rackets to the faction.

Some of the yakuza factions take pride in having the code, such as not hurting the civilians, while some of the factions are lawless and crude.

The yakuza factions with codes offer protection to the civilians under their care, but the society of Kowloon as well has vigilante groups, who are specialized in ensuring the peace of their neighborhoods.

For the dominance of Kowloon is ruled by capitalism, it will never have a sole champion, and the wars will never see the end but forever flourish.

Yet, that is the glamor of Kowloon, and people come and desire to live in this world for the life of the yakuza warfare.

Even today, the city of Kowloon is bristled with the noise of people and businesses, and the never-ending wars of the yakuza who reign over them.
